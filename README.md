# apex_legends_analysis
This repository holds my apex legends analysis project

# Purpose
Having recently finished a R data analysis course, I wanted to further solidify what I learned by creating a project. I decuded to use apex legends data because it is one of my favorite game at the moment. The dataset I used included things like the legend name, their class, damage, kills, assists, etc. 

# Tools used
tidyr for cleaning up the data
dplyr for manipulating and aggregating
ggplot to create visualizations
